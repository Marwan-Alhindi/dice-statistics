This file is used to analyse the probability of the number that would occur when rolling one, two or multiple dices. By using Plotly, we will have an interactive plots for the user to represent each number occuarance probability. You learned how to use the function Bar and the function Layout from plotl (x,y titles and the graph title). The result of this file was that when a single D6 dice is being rolled E.g. 1000 times, the probability distribution of each side is equal. But when you roll two dice together, the most frequent number occur is 7.
The Data Visualization project starts in Chapter 15, in which you'll learn to generate data and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly. Chapter 16 teaches you to access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a map of global earthquake activity. Finally, Chapter 17 shows you how to write a program to automatically download and visualize data. Learning to make visualizations allows you to explore the field of data mining, which is a highly sought-after skill in the world today.
